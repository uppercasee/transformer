## Introduction

The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need," revolutionized sequence-to-sequence tasks in natural language processing. This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model, including the encoder, decoder, and various components such as attention mechanisms and positional embeddings.

## Installation

To use the Transformer model, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
- TODO: Add requirement.txt file

## Usage

To use the Transformer model in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uppercasee/transformer.git
cd transformer
```

2. Import the Transformer model in your Python code:

```python
from transformers import Transformer
```

3. Create an instance of the Transformer model and use it in your application:

```python
# Example code
model = Transformer(...)
```
